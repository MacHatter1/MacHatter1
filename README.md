👋 Hello! I'm Tom 🏴, a passionate Web Developer dedicated to crafting dynamic and responsive web solutions. My toolkit includes a broad range of technologies such as PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Python, jQuery, Redis, Memcache, Linux, and CSS.

👀 I have a keen interest in evolving web technologies and am always exploring new ways to enhance web functionality and user experience.

🌱 Currently, I'm on a learning journey with React, diving deep into its ecosystem to build more interactive and stateful UIs.

💞️ I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects. Collaborating on such initiatives allows me to share my skills, learn from the community, and help shape the future of web development.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project or if you think we can create something amazing together!
